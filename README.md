Welcome to the Growstuff project.

Growstuff is an open source/open data project to create a website for
food gardeners.  We crowdsource information on what our members are
growing and harvesting, aggregate it, and make it available as open data
via our API.

Growstuff was founded in 2012 and has been built by dozens of
[contributors](CONTRIBUTORS.md).  We are an inclusive, welcoming project, and
encourage participation from people of all backgrounds and skill levels.
